        </div>
        <div id="brief-history-text">
          <p>My interest in coding started in Year 9, when I was introduced to Python in an IT lesson. I was so interested I went home and willingly researched more about Python (which is unusual for a 13 year old). I battled with deciding what to do for college, but due to mental health reasons (though I wasn't aware of them at the time) I went with Art & Design. It wasn't until I started working that I fell back in love with the hobby of coding, and it made me realise that this is what I want to do with my life.</p>

This database will manage purchases, accounts, categories of products, and products themselves. There is a lot more I could add if I wanted to simulate a fully working website and I wish to learn enough to integrate as much as I can into this project in the future. I've recently learnt how to send a post request to a server to interact with my backend, and now know roughly how I would be able to integrate interactions with Python and the MySQL database I have constructed for this website.<br><br>This project taught and reinforced a lot of skills, including: responsive website layouts, Javascript integration and interactivity, MySQL database design and creation, function creation, and maintanence. I'm still learning to integrate Python into this workflow and I hope to introduce AJAX to connect the frontend to the backend.</p>

I love game development, and this was my first proper attempt at creating a demo. I had much fun learning the ins and outs of the unity engine (which my Godot experience definitely helped with), and also learning how to create complex systems using composition concepts as a key value. I tried making this as dynamic as possible, meaning that creating new objects is easier and quicker. This taught me a lot about programming practices, and also a lot about my own personal persistence, since everything is not going to work first try without some immense luck. This gave me plenty of challenges that I absolutely loved figuring out solutions to.<br><br>Whilst it isn't a Minimum Viable Product, I think the direciton is clear and measured. The main thing design wise that I struggled with was finding insentives to use the unique ability of the lasso. I eventually figured it out by making it reward you greatly whilst also being slightly difficult to pull off. High risk, high reward.</p>
